## Feature Status & Roadmap

FireSchema aims to provide a robust, type-safe interface for Firestore across multiple platforms. Here's a snapshot of current support and future plans:

| Target Platform         | Status      | Supported SDK¬π                 | Test Coverage¬≤                     | Key Features / Notes                                                                                                                               |
| :---------------------- | :---------- | :----------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TypeScript (Client)** | ‚úÖ Supported | `firebase` v9+ (Modular)       | Unit & Integration (Emulator)    | Ideal for Web Apps (React, Vue, etc.) & Node.js clients. Full CRUD, Querying, Streaming, Subcollections, Transactions/Batches.                       |
| **TypeScript (Admin)**  | ‚úÖ Supported | `firebase-admin` (Node.js)     | Unit & Integration (Emulator)    | Ideal for Backends (Node.js, Cloud Functions). Full CRUD, Querying, Subcollections, Transactions/Batches. **No Streaming.**                           |
| **Dart (Client)**       | ‚úÖ Supported | `cloud_firestore` (Flutter)    | Unit (Fake) & Integration (Emulator) | Ideal for Flutter Apps & Dart clients. Full CRUD, Querying, Streaming, Subcollections, Transactions/Batches. Includes `serverTimestamp` handling on `add`. |
| **Dart (Admin/Server)** | ‚è≥ Planned   | Firestore REST API             | N/A                                | Target: `dart-admin-rest` (tentative). **Addresses lack of official Dart Admin SDK**, enabling type-safe backend Dart Firestore access.             |
| **C# (Client)**         | ‚úÖ Supported | `Google.Cloud.Firestore`       | Unit & Integration (Emulator)    | Target: `csharp-client`. For .NET applications (ASP.NET Core, MAUI, Blazor, Unity via .NET Standard 2.1). Full CRUD, Querying, Updates.             |

**Core Features (Supported across all current runtimes):**

-   JSON Schema Definition (`timestamp`, `geopoint`, `reference`, `$ref`, basic validation)
-   Configuration File (`fireschema.config.json`)
-   Code Generation CLI (`fireschema generate`)
-   Type-Safe Data Models (`Data`, `AddData`, Nested Types, Enums)
-   Type-Safe Collection References with CRUD (`get`, `add`, `set`, `delete`)
-   Type-Safe Query Builders (`where[Field]`, `orderBy`, `limit`, Cursors, `in`, `array-contains`, etc.)
-   Type-Safe Update Builders (`set[Field]`, `increment[Field]`, `serverTimestamp`, `updateRaw` for `FieldValue`)
-   Subcollection Accessors

**Notes:**

1.  You must install the specified Firebase SDK alongside the corresponding FireSchema runtime package in your project.
2.  Test coverage indicates that automated tests exist for core runtime functionality. See individual runtime guides for more specifics.

For detailed usage, please refer to the specific guides for each runtime target. See the [Roadmap](./guide/roadmap.md) page for more details on planned features.
