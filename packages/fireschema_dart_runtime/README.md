# fireschema_dart_runtime

This package provides the runtime library for Dart/Flutter code generated by the
[FireSchema](https://github.com/your_org/fireschema) tool. It contains the base
classes and utilities necessary for the generated Object Document Mapper (ODM)
code to interact with Google Cloud Firestore.

## Features

- Provides base classes (`BaseCollectionRef`, `BaseQueryBuilder`,
  `BaseUpdateBuilder`) for generated code.
- Includes helper functions for common Firestore operations used by generated
  code.

## Getting started

You typically don't add this package to your `pubspec.yaml` directly. It will be
added as a dependency by the `fireschema` tool when generating Dart code.

However, if you need to install it manually:

```yaml
dependencies:
    fireschema_dart_runtime: ^0.1.0 # Use the desired version
    cloud_firestore: ^4.0.0 # Ensure you have the Firestore plugin
```

Then run `flutter pub get` or `dart pub get`.

## Usage

This package is intended for internal use by the code generated by `fireschema`.
The generated classes (e.g., `UsersCollection`, `UsersQueryBuilder`,
`UsersUpdateBuilder`) extend the base classes provided by this runtime.

Refer to the main
[FireSchema documentation](https://github.com/your_org/fireschema) for details
on how to use the generated code in your Flutter or Dart application.
