# @shtse8/fireschema-runtime

This package provides the runtime library for TypeScript code generated by the
[FireSchema](https://github.com/shtse8/FireSchema) tool. It contains the base
classes and utilities necessary for the generated Object Document Mapper (ODM)
code to interact with Google Firestore.

## Installation

This package is intended to be a **peer dependency** of your project when using
code generated by `fireschema`. Ensure it's installed alongside the `firebase`
package. However, if you need to install it manually:

```bash
npm install @shtse8/fireschema-runtime firebase
# or
yarn add @shtse8/fireschema-runtime firebase
# or
pnpm add @shtse8/fireschema-runtime firebase
```

**Note:** This package requires `firebase` (version 9, 10, or 11) as a peer
dependency.

## Usage

This package is intended for internal use by the code generated by `fireschema`.
The generated classes (e.g., `UsersCollection`, `UsersQueryBuilder`,
`UsersUpdateBuilder`) extend the base classes provided by this runtime
(`BaseCollectionRef`, `BaseQueryBuilder`, `BaseUpdateBuilder`).

Refer to the main
[FireSchema documentation](https://github.com/shtse8/FireSchema) for details on
how to use the generated code.
