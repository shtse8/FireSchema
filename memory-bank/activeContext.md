# Active Context: FireSchema (Ready for Next Task)

**Current Focus:** GitHub Pages deployment successfully fixed and verified. Ready to proceed with the next task.

**Recent Changes:**

-   **(Completed) Fix GitHub Pages Deployment:**
    -   Initially identified documentation links in `README.md` and `base` path in VitePress config (`docs-src/.vitepress/config.mts`) pointing to `/FireSchema/`.
    -   *Mistakenly* assumed the correct path should be `/firestore-odm/` based on the repository name.
    -   *Incorrectly* changed `README.md` links and VitePress `base` path to `/firestore-odm/`.
    -   User clarified that the project name and intended base path is indeed `/FireSchema/`.
    -   **Corrected** `README.md` links back to use `https://shtse8.github.io/FireSchema/`.
    -   **Corrected** VitePress `base` path in `docs-src/.vitepress/config.mts` back to `/FireSchema/`.
    -   Committed and pushed these initial fixes.
    -   Verified deployment via Playwright, found site returned 404.
    -   Checked GitHub Actions status (`gh run list`), confirmed workflow success, but site remained 404.
    -   Investigated workflow logs (`gh run view --log`), identified `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` was copying from the wrong directory (`./docs` instead of `./`).
    -   Corrected `publish_dir` in `.github/workflows/publish.yml` to `./`. Committed and pushed.
    -   Verified deployment again, still 404. Workflow logs showed `actions/deploy-pages` step failed with generic error `Deployment failed, try again later.`.
    -   Attempted fix by creating a `.tar.gz` artifact in the workflow to handle potential symlinks. Committed and pushed.
    -   Deployment still failed with the same generic error.
    -   **Final Fix:** Reverted to uploading the `./docs` directory directly but switched to using the official `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3` action instead of `actions/upload-artifact@v4`. Modified the `deploy-docs` job to use `actions/configure-pages@v5` and `actions/deploy-pages@v4` without specifying `artifact_name`. Committed and pushed.
    -   **Verified:** Workflow completed successfully, and Playwright confirmed `https://shtse8.github.io/FireSchema/` is now live and displaying correctly.
-   **(Previous) Improve Documentation with Diagrams:**
    -   Reviewed core documentation files.
    -   Corrected minor issues in runtime guides.
    -   Added Mermaid diagrams to key guides.
-   **(Previous) Verify Runtime CI Status:**
    -   Checked CI status for all three runtime packages. Dart runtime CI only runs unit tests. TS runtimes passed on last tag.
-   **(Previous) Fix `fireschema_dart_runtime` CI:**
    -   Modified Dart runtime CI to only run unit tests due to persistent `PlatformException` in integration tests on CI.
-   **(Previous) Repository Split, Submodule Setup & Initial Runtime Repo Config:**
    -   Split runtimes into separate repos and configured them as submodules.
    -   Set up initial CI/CD workflows in each runtime repo.
-   **(Previous) Documentation Restructure & Content:**
    -   Restructured VitePress site and updated content.
-   **(Previous) Executor + Adapter Refactor:**
    -   Refactored generator and runtimes.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **(Future) Verify `fireschema_dart_runtime` CI:** Confirm that the workflow passes when triggered by the next version tag (running only unit tests).
2.  **(Future) Implement More Adapters:** Add adapters for new targets (e.g., `dart-admin-rest`, `csharp-client`).
3.  **(Future) Generator Enhancements:** Add support for more complex schema validation rules, improve error reporting.
4.  **(Future) Documentation:** Continue refining and expanding the VitePress documentation content (e.g., add Contributing guide, more examples).
